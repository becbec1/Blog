## UI vs UX

Wow! It has been a crazy 3 weeks! I'm at the bootcamp usually 12 hours on the weekdays and half a day on Saturdays. So no surprise that I haven't posted in awhile.
I have SO MUCH to talk about and so little time...... I guess I'll talk about the most surprising aspects of my experience so far...

One of the hardest experiences so far has been learning to prioritize what I spend most of my attention on. We are learning Dev (coding), UI (the visual aspects), and UX (user experience ). I want to master them all but realistically I can only really master one,  or be so-so in all three. I thought that it would be fairly easy to pick one and I figured it would be the visual design (UI). But right now I'm torn between UI and UX.


UX design is, not surprisingly, focused on on how the user interacts with your design rather than what they see. A product could be stunning visually but if it's unclear on how to interact with it or is frustrating to use it is a failure. At the heart of it UX is about being empathic to your user and that really appeals to me. 


I guess you and I will just have to wait and see which field I pick, so stay tuned.
